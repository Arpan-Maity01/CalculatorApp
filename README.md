# CalculatorApp
 The code is for a basic calculator. It allows the user to enter two numbers and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division on those numbers. The results of the calculations are displayed in a label. The code is well-written and easy to follow. The functions for each of the mathematical operations are clearly defined and easy to understand. The use of the `tkinter` library makes it easy to create a user-friendly interface for the calculator. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the code works: 1. The user enters two numbers into the two text boxes. 2. The `add()`, `substract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()` functions are called, depending on which button the user clicks. 3. The `add()`, `substract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()` functions each take two arguments: the first argument is the number entered in the first text box, and the second argument is the number entered in the second text box. 4. The `add()` function adds the two numbers together and returns the result. 5. The `substract()` function subtracts the second number from the first number and returns the result. 6. The `multiply()` function multiplies the two numbers together and returns the result. 7. The `divide()` function divides the first number by the second number and returns the result. 8. The result of the calculation is displayed in the label. I hope this explanation is helpful.
